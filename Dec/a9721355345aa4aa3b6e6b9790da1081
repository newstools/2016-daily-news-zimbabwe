WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama has said that he ordered Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin to &quot;cut it out&quot; in a conversation about email hacking ahead of the US election. Implying that the Russian president knew about the hacks, Mr Obama said: &quot;Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.&quot; The president said he had warned Mr Putin of serious consequences at a summit in September. A month later, the US accused Russia of meddling in its democratic process. The president has promised a &quot;proportional&quot; response to the hacking of the Democratic Party and of emails belonging to defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign chairman. He appeared to suggest that the US could go on the offensive with its own cyber muscle, stating: &quot;Whatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them.&quot; Mr Obama&#39;s comments came during his last news conference of the year.
